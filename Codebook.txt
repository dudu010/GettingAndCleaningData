Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project - October 2014

1. Introduction
This Codebook describes a data set, the result of an R script developed as
part of a course project from Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data.


2. Data Sources
The data set was built based on the following data source:

This material is part of a research project, "Human Activity Recognition
Using Smartphones", developed by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, 
Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, from Universite degli Studi di Genova.

Follow a brief description of the mentioned research project:
"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an
age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, 
WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a 
smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer
and gyroscope, it was captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular
velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz".


3. The Data Set
The data set is composed by 68 distict variables described as follow:

"subject", an integer from 1 to 30, identifying each volunteer in
the experiment.

"activity", among the set (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,
SITTING, STANDING, LAYING), the activity performed by the subject when the
measures were captured.

The other 66 variables represent the mean of each measure captured for each 
subject in each activity. Actually it was considered just the variables
regarding mean and std from the source files. Follow below the list of 
variables where the mean was calculated. For detail information regarding
each of these measurements, please refer to the original document of the
experiment: http://http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
